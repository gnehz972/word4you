**Usage Notes:**

*   "Nice" is a versatile adjective and can be used in a wide range of contexts.
*   It often describes things that are pleasing to the senses or enjoyable experiences.
*   It can also be used to describe people, referring to their kindness, friendliness, or pleasant character.
*   While generally positive, "nice" can sometimes be considered a somewhat weak word, and more specific adjectives might be preferable in some situations (e.g., "beautiful," "delicious," "kindhearted"). However, it's perfectly acceptable in everyday conversation.
*   "Nice" can also be used ironically or sarcastically, although the meaning is then the opposite of the definition (e.g., "That's a nice mess you've made!"). Context and intonation are key to understanding this usage.
*   Common collocations include: "a nice person," "a nice day," "a nice view," "a nice gesture."
