## test

**Phonetic:** /tɛst/

**Chinese Translation:** 测试 (cè shì) / 试验 (shì yàn)

**Example Sentence:**
- English: We need to test the software before releasing it.
- Chinese: 我们需要在发布软件之前测试它。(Wǒmen xūyào zài fābù ruǎnjiàn zhīqián cèshì tā.)

**Definition:** A procedure intended to establish the quality, performance, or reliability of something, especially before it is taken into widespread use. It can also be an examination of someone's knowledge or ability.

**Usage Notes:**

*   **Broad Applications:** "Test" has a very broad application. It can refer to:
    *   **Examinations/Assessments:** (e.g., a math test, a blood test) - evaluating skills, knowledge, or condition.
    *   **Experimentation/Evaluation:** (e.g., testing a new product, testing a hypothesis) - determining the qualities or effectiveness of something.
    *   **Trials/Experiences:** (e.g., putting someone to the test) -  subjecting someone or something to a difficult situation to see how they perform.

*   **Verb vs. Noun:** "Test" functions as both a noun and a verb.
    *   **Noun:**  "I took a test."
    *   **Verb:**  "I need to test the new software."

*   **Collocations:** Common collocations include:
    *   "take a test" (参加考试 - cānjiā kǎoshì)
    *   "run a test" (进行测试 - jìnxíng cèshì)
    *   "pass a test" (通过考试 - tōngguò kǎoshì)
    *   "fail a test" (考试不及格 - kǎoshì bù jígé)

*   **Context is Key:** The exact meaning of "test" is heavily dependent on the context in which it's used. Understanding the surrounding words will help you determine whether it refers to an examination, an experiment, or a challenging situation.

*   **Figurative Usage:** "Test" can be used figuratively to describe something that proves or confirms something else. For example: "His success is a test of his hard work." (他的成功是他努力的证明 - Tā de chénggōng shì tā nǔlì de zhèngmíng.)

*   **Distinguishing from similar words:** While "experiment" (实验 - shíyàn) and "test" (测试 - cèshì) are sometimes interchangeable, "experiment" often implies a more scientific and exploratory process, whereas "test" is often more focused on verifying a specific property or performance.  "Trial" (试验 - shìyàn/审判 - shěnpàn) can also mean "test", but it often implies a limited-scale application to check feasibility or effectiveness, or in the legal context, a judicial examination.

## example

**Phonetic:** [ɪɡˈzæmpl]

**Chinese Translation:** 例子 (lìzi) - means "instance," "case," or "sample." Can also be translated as 实例 (shílì) which means "concrete example."

**Example Sentence:**
- English: This recipe provides a good example of Italian cuisine.
- Chinese: 这个食谱提供了一个意大利美食的好例子。(Zhège shípǔ tígōng le yī gè Yìdàlì měishí de hǎo lìzi.)

**Definition:** A thing characteristic of its kind or illustrating a general rule. Also, a person or thing worthy of imitation; a pattern.

**Usage Notes:**

*   "Example" can be used both as a countable noun (e.g., "Give me an example") and an uncountable noun (e.g., "For example, ...").
*   Common phrases include: "for example," "a good example," "to give an example," "set an example."
*   The word often implies that the thing used to illustrate the rule or principle is representative and helpful for understanding.
*   Pay attention to the context to decide if a more specific word like "instance," "illustration," or "demonstration" might be a better fit.
*   In some cases, "sample" or "prototype" might be appropriate alternatives.
*   When referring to someone who is a role model, "example" emphasizes the act of emulation or following their behavior.

## good

**Phonetic:** [ɡʊd]

**Chinese Translation:** 好的 (hǎo de), 好 (hǎo), 不错 (bù cuò), 优秀 (yōu xiù), 善 (shàn)

**Example Sentence:**
- English: This is a good book.
- Chinese: 这是一本好书。(Zhè shì yī běn hǎo shū.)

**Definition:** Morally excellent; virtuous; righteous; pleasing; satisfactory; of high quality; effective; skillful; healthy; well-behaved; pleasant; enjoyable. It's a general term of approval or desirability.

**Usage Notes:**

*   "Good" is an adjective, and often needs a noun to modify (e.g., "a good day," "good food").
*   "Well" is typically used as an adverb (modifying a verb) to describe how something is done (e.g., "He sings well"). However, "well" is also an adjective meaning healthy (e.g., "I feel well"). Be mindful of this distinction to avoid common errors.
*   "Good" can also be used as a noun, referring to something beneficial or desirable (e.g., "for the common good").  This usage is less common in everyday conversation.
*   Colloquially, "good" can be used as an intensifier, often redundant (e.g., "a good long time").
*   "Good at" is a common phrase followed by a gerund (verb + -ing) or a noun, meaning skillful or proficient in something (e.g., "He is good at playing the piano").
*   Avoid using "good" as a substitute for "well" when describing physical health or ability (e.g., say "I am well," not "I am good"). Though "I'm good" can mean "I'm okay" in response to "How are you?", it is grammatically less precise.
*   In some contexts, "good" can imply moral correctness or righteousness (e.g., "a good person").
*   It's a versatile word, but be aware of more specific adjectives that might be more appropriate depending on the context, such as "excellent," "outstanding," "wonderful," or "amazing."

## test

**Chinese Translation:** 测试 (cèshì), 试验 (shìyàn)

**Example Sentence:**

**Definition:** A procedure intended to establish the quality, performance, or reliability of something, especially before it is taken into widespread use. It can also refer to an examination of someone's knowledge of a subject.

*   As a noun, it often refers to an examination (e.g., "a spelling test") or a trial (e.g., "a stress test").
*   As a verb, it means to examine or try something to determine its quality or suitability (e.g., "We need to test this product before launching it").
*   In scientific contexts, "test" is used to describe experiments or investigations designed to verify or disprove a hypothesis.
*   The word "exam" is often used interchangeably with "test," but "exam" generally refers to a more formal and comprehensive assessment.
*   Common phrases include: "test out," "test run," "put to the test," "stand the test of time."
*   Consider the specific context when translating into Chinese. "测试" (cèshì) is generally used for technical testing or evaluation. "试验" (shìyàn) is used for scientific experiments or trials.

## nice

**Usage Notes:**

*   It often describes things that are pleasing to the senses or enjoyable experiences.
*   It can also be used to describe people, referring to their kindness, friendliness, or pleasant character.
*   While generally positive, "nice" can sometimes be considered a somewhat weak word, and more specific adjectives might be preferable in some situations (e.g., "beautiful," "delicious," "kindhearted"). However, it's perfectly acceptable in everyday conversation.
*   "Nice" can also be used ironically or sarcastically, although the meaning is then the opposite of the definition (e.g., "That's a nice mess you've made!"). Context and intonation are key to understanding this usage.
