## good

**Phonetic:** [ɡʊd]

**Chinese Translation:** 好的 (hǎo de), 好 (hǎo), 不错 (bù cuò), 优秀 (yōu xiù), 善 (shàn)

**Example Sentence:**
- English: This is a good book.
- Chinese: 这是一本好书。(Zhè shì yī běn hǎo shū.)

**Definition:** Morally excellent; virtuous; righteous; pleasing; satisfactory; of high quality; effective; skillful; healthy; well-behaved; pleasant; enjoyable. It's a general term of approval or desirability.

**Usage Notes:**

*   "Good" is an adjective, and often needs a noun to modify (e.g., "a good day," "good food").
*   "Well" is typically used as an adverb (modifying a verb) to describe how something is done (e.g., "He sings well"). However, "well" is also an adjective meaning healthy (e.g., "I feel well"). Be mindful of this distinction to avoid common errors.
*   "Good" can also be used as a noun, referring to something beneficial or desirable (e.g., "for the common good").  This usage is less common in everyday conversation.
*   Colloquially, "good" can be used as an intensifier, often redundant (e.g., "a good long time").
*   "Good at" is a common phrase followed by a gerund (verb + -ing) or a noun, meaning skillful or proficient in something (e.g., "He is good at playing the piano").
*   Avoid using "good" as a substitute for "well" when describing physical health or ability (e.g., say "I am well," not "I am good"). Though "I'm good" can mean "I'm okay" in response to "How are you?", it is grammatically less precise.
*   In some contexts, "good" can imply moral correctness or righteousness (e.g., "a good person").
*   It's a versatile word, but be aware of more specific adjectives that might be more appropriate depending on the context, such as "excellent," "outstanding," "wonderful," or "amazing."

## test

**Phonetic:** [tɛst]

**Chinese Translation:** 测试 (cèshì), 试验 (shìyàn)

**Example Sentence:**
- English: The teacher will give us a math test on Friday.
- Chinese: 老师星期五会给我们进行一次数学测试。(Lǎoshī xīngqíwǔ huì gěi wǒmen jìnxíng yīcì shùxué cèshì.)

**Definition:** A procedure intended to establish the quality, performance, or reliability of something, especially before it is taken into widespread use. It can also refer to an examination of someone's knowledge of a subject.

**Usage Notes:**

*   "Test" is a versatile word that can function as both a noun and a verb.
*   As a noun, it often refers to an examination (e.g., "a spelling test") or a trial (e.g., "a stress test").
*   As a verb, it means to examine or try something to determine its quality or suitability (e.g., "We need to test this product before launching it").
*   In scientific contexts, "test" is used to describe experiments or investigations designed to verify or disprove a hypothesis.
*   The word "exam" is often used interchangeably with "test," but "exam" generally refers to a more formal and comprehensive assessment.
*   Common phrases include: "test out," "test run," "put to the test," "stand the test of time."
*   Consider the specific context when translating into Chinese. "测试" (cèshì) is generally used for technical testing or evaluation. "试验" (shìyàn) is used for scientific experiments or trials. "考试" (kǎoshì) refers to an examination in an academic setting. "考验" (kǎoyàn) can be used when referring to a trial of someone's character or resilience.

## nice

**Phonetic:** /naɪs/

**Chinese Translation:** 好的; 友好的; 令人愉快的; 美好的

**Example Sentence:**
- English: It was a nice day for a picnic.
- Chinese: 今天是个适合野餐的好日子。

**Usage Notes:**

*   "Nice" is a versatile adjective and can be used in a wide range of contexts.
*   It often describes things that are pleasing to the senses or enjoyable experiences.
*   It can also be used to describe people, referring to their kindness, friendliness, or pleasant character.
*   While generally positive, "nice" can sometimes be considered a somewhat weak word, and more specific adjectives might be preferable in some situations (e.g., "beautiful," "delicious," "kindhearted"). However, it's perfectly acceptable in everyday conversation.
*   "Nice" can also be used ironically or sarcastically, although the meaning is then the opposite of the definition (e.g., "That's a nice mess you've made!"). Context and intonation are key to understanding this usage.
*   Common collocations include: "a nice person," "a nice day," "a nice view," "a nice gesture."
